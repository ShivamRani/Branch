# Branch
Branch : A platform that go beyond the traditional tools to create innovative methods of exchanging knowledge.
The regular school schedule had gone for a toss in the lockdown. The digital divide is pervasive. Most of the challenges faced by the students are due to chaotic situations. We say so because the top most challenges that we researched across social media platforms highlighted studentâ€™s discomfort to adapt to the new changing class environment. So, Branch is a solution considering all the pain points of student as well as of teachers.
